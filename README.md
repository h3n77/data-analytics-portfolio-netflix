# 🎬 Netflix Top 10 Analysis: Weekly Chart-Toppers (2021-2023)

### 📋 Project Overview
This project explores Netflix's weekly top 10 lists for most watched TV shows and films worldwide. Using a dataset spanning from **June 2021 to August 2023**, I investigated trends in content popularity and the impact of duration on rankings.

### 🎯 Key Objectives
- **Combine** global categories into a unified weekly view.
- **Analyze** regional trends (with a focus on Argentina).
- **Correlation Study:** Determine if content duration affects the likelihood of reaching the Top 10.

### 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **SQL:** Used for complex data extraction and regional performance metrics.
- **Python (Pandas):** Used for data cleaning, shape manipulation, and exploratory analysis.
- **Data Source:** [Netflix Official Top 10 Data](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/)

### 📊 Key Insight
My SQL analysis revealed that regional preferences differ significantly from global trends. For example, in Argentina, the show **"Pasión de Gavilanes"** dominated the charts for a staggering **82 weeks**, highlighting the long term staying power of specific soap opera content compared to global film hits.
